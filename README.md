I want to see if I can make this into a macOS app that sits in the toolbar and I can simply click it, or run the app in terminal and it closes based on a preset user preference. 

Then see if I can figure it out for Linux / Windows and bundle it into a single downloadable app and the user selects or the app preselects the OS.
